# To-Do List Applicationüìù

## Project Overview
This project is a simple yet functional To-Do List application built using React. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed or pending. The application also provides a filtering feature to view tasks based on their completion status.

## Features
+ Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
+ Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their list.
+ Toggle Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending by clicking on them.
+ Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks to view all, only completed, or only pending tasks.
+ Responsive Design: Basic styling ensures the application is usable on different screen sizes.

## Achievments 
+ Interactive UI: The application provides a smooth and interactive user experience with responsive design elements.
+ State Management: Utilizes React's state management to handle the addition, deletion, and toggling of tasks effectively.
+ Component-Based Architecture: Demonstrates the use of React components (App, TaskInput, and TaskList) to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
+ Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to ensure that functions are properly used and validated.

## Components
+ App.js
    + Main component that manages the application state and contains the logic for adding, deleting, and toggling tasks.
    + Renders the TaskInput and TaskList components and handles task filtering.
